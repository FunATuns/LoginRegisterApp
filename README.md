# LoginRegisterApp
A relatively basic app that contains a web client that interfaces with a node.js server. The node server then uses a MongoDB database to store data about the user profiles made through the client.

# Setup
All the node modules are preinstalled, all one has to do is run index.js in the node command prompt and run a local MongoDB along side. After that index.html in the public folder can be opened in any web browser.
